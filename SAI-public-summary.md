# Feasibility and Implications of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection
*Zoe Iczkovitz, Alesia Leung, Maya Mahmood, Alyssia Naran, and Priya Rai*

Global warming, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is causing severe climate impacts worldwide. One proposed strategy to adapt to climate change is solar radiation management (SRM), which manages incoming solar radiation by increasing the reflectivity of Earth’s surface, also called albedo (Pope et al. 2012). 

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is an SRM strategy that introduces aerosols, typically sulfur dioxide (SO2), into the stratosphere to increase Earth's albedo (Figure 1) (Vattioni et al. 2024). SAI aims to mimic the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions, which release sulfur plumes that reflect incoming solar radiation (Ming et al. 2014). While environmental models suggest SAI could limit global warming, environmental, social, technological, geopolitical, and financial factors must be considered.

*Figure 1. SAI works by injecting aerosols, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), into the stratosphere (15 to 50 km above Earth’s surface), through injection mechanisms such as drones, tethered balloons, and aircrafts. This is meant to mimic the cooling effects of large volcanic eruptions. Incoming solar radiation is then able to be reflected off of aerosol particles which creates a cooling effect (Ming et al. 2014) (Authors’ Own Work).* 

## Technological Feasibility

The technological feasibility of SAI relies on efficient delivery methods, optimal locations, and long-term monitoring. Aerosols, such as SO2, could be delivered to the stratosphere via aircraft, drones, or balloons. Aircrafts offer large-scale delivery but would require significant modifications, while drones and balloons provide flexibility and lower costs (Lockley, MacMartin, and Hunt 2020). Ideal injection locations are remote, stable regions, such as oceanic areas, to minimize risks and ensure predictable aerosol dispersion (Zhang et al. 2024). Additionally, to maintain effective cooling, continuous monitoring is essential to track aerosol concentrations and their long-term impact.


## Environmental Impacts
SAI affects the environment by altering temperature, precipitation, air quality, and the carbon cycle (Figure 2). While it can reduce global temperatures and mitigate droughts, it may lead to regional disparities such as drying in Mainland Southeast Asia or flooding in Northern Europe (Narenpitak et al. 2024; Liu, Lang, and Jiang 2024). These changes pose risks to ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources (Clark et al. 2023). Abrupt termination of SAI, known as "Termination Shock," could severely worsen global warming and accelerate CO2 release (Tang and Kemp 2021).

*Figure 2. Potential environmental impacts of SAI across major categories. Temperature: SAI can reduce global warming by reflecting sunlight and aiding in the restoration of sea ice (Lee et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2024). Precipitation: SAI alters rainfall patterns, increasing dry months and reducing monsoon precipitation in Mainland Southeast Asia, while intensifying flood risks in Northern Europe. It also globally modifies drought frequency, duration, and severity (Narenpitak et al. 2024; Liu, Lang, and Jiang 2024). Air Quality: SAI depletes atmospheric ozone and contributes to air pollution (Tracy et al. 2022). Carbon Cycle: SAI enhances ocean carbon uptake, but it has mixed effects on land carbon uptake (Cao 2018). However, these impacts carry some uncertainties, as they come from different climate models with varying parameters. Further, the extent and distribution of environmental effects depend on the scale, strategy, and location of SAI injections (Authors’ Own Work).*


## Geopolitical Considerations 
The global impacts of SAI require a decision-making process that is inclusive of all nations (Flegal and Gupta 2018; Smith et al. 2022). Although international organizations have advised the need for governance, there is yet to be a collective approach to SAI research, planning, and deployment (Frumhoff and Stephens 2018; Kravitz et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2022). Conflicting environmental goals further reduce the political motivation of politicians to engage in such governance (Reynolds 2019). 


## Financial Considerations
As mentioned, SAI can be deployed by various delivery systems, with annual operational costs summarized in Table 1.

In comparison to other popular SRMs, SAI is generally considered one of the more economically feasible and extensively researched options, as shown in Table 2 (Amis et al. 2019).

## Social Impacts

SAI raises social considerations regarding ethics, public perceptions, and unintended environmental and health impacts. For instance, elite groups may dominate decision-making, marginalizing vulnerable populations most affected by SAI’s negative consequences (Grasso 2022). Decisions on SAI implementation must equitably include diverse cultural and socioeconomic perspectives (Grasso 2022). SAI can also create a "moral hazard" where reliance on technological fixes undermines mitigation efforts (Corner and Pidgeon 2010). Additionally, the environmental risks of SAI could exacerbate health disparities in communities lacking the resources to manage additional public health issues (Carlson et al. 2022). 


## Recommendations and Conclusions

While theoretically capable of reducing global temperatures, SAI faces significant uncertainties, including technical, geopolitical, and environmental risks, as well as the potential to exacerbate inequalities and hinder mitigation efforts. Instead of relying on SAI, global strategies should prioritize addressing the root causes of climate change through proven solutions like reducing greenhouse gases, as well as adopting renewable energy and sustainable practices for meaningful and lasting impact (Corner and Pidgeon 2010).
